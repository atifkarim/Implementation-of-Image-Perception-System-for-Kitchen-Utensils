installing tensorflow using gpu is a problem that I have faced. So, here following which way I have installed tensorrflow correctly I am writing it down.

before starting this check CUDA,CUDNN has setup. GPU driver has setup. check with the following command
nvcc -V

GPU driver has setup. check with the following command
nvidia-smi

If YES proceed. Otherwise set it up. (MAYBE follow it -- https://www.pytorials.com/how-to-install-tensorflow-gpu-with-cuda-9-2-for-python-on-ubuntu/)



1/ first of all god to create a virtual environment.
I am writing here the steps and aso before the nxt point I have given also the link.
---- check pip is updated or not. if NOT please update it. follow the link I have given below.
---- python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv (if virtualenv lib is not installled)
---- python3 -m venv name_of_virtual_env
---- source ~/name_of_virtual_env/bin/activate (I am assuming that you are creating virtual env in the root folder. This line will activate venv.)

Now you are done. Now the steps to instal library. here, our focus would be to install tf with gpu.

2/ I have followed this link https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12388#issuecomment-402307127. you can try with your own. maybe one problem will encounter with tf version. I haven't tested
for other version. I have used 1.8.0

pip uninstall tensorflow
pip uninstall tensorflow-gpu
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.8.0

!!!! you will see that in this answer he has also installed "pip install tensorflow==1.8.0" but I have omitted it. I will check it later is it important or not.

3/  now Keras.

for some reason I have installed a specific version of keras. you can follow it https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/5852

pip install keras==2.1.2

But here this time I have got a new error while want to save model in h5 format. Then I have solved that issue by following https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model(bottom)

sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev


to check tf is using gpu or not --- 
import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))


another way but didn't understand properly ---
from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib
print(device_lib.list_local_devices())



to check keras is using gpu or not ---
from keras import backend as K
K.tensorflow_backend._get_available_gpus()
